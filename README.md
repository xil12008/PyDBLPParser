# PyDBLPParser
Python code parsing DBLP and stores researchers' publication relationships at Cayley, a graph database which accelerate the speed of queries on the publications relationship among researchers.

Notes:
 - File required: dblp.xml dblp.dtd
 - Cayley, a graph-based database should be installed and launched before running this script
 - This takes me around 1-2 days to finish converting in a normal PC

Currently, books are not considered.
